## Structure of code
In this project, there are lists of studio Ghibli movies, ranked from the best to the worst.
Using 'fetch' will get all the data that will show the lists of movies. I fetched the data from this URL [https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films].
When that is finished, I ranked the movies from the best to the worst, using sort(), then I display the result in html within a few attributes I had chosen from the film object. 

## Most challenging part?
I would say that the project is not that hard to solve, but debugging is the most challenging part for me, and it always there. It always take me a lot of time to find the bugs.
What was the most challenging part for you?

Thanks for this project!
